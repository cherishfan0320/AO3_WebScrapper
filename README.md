## AO3 Web Scrapper
Web Scrape The best works(**have Kudo Rates 1/9**) on AO3, based on Famdom/Relationship and Additional Tags.  <br />
Hopefully output csv with Title, Author, Link and Description on Local Drive. <br />

## Coding/Running Environment
Used CoLab to run everything, csv file can save locally. <br />

## Notes
Might face problem when scraping multiple pages(sometimes have errors after 120 pages) <br />
If meet error, try to break down pages, and refresh/wait for several mins to run again. <br />

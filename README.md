# AO3_WebScrapper
Web Scrape The best works(have Kudo Rates 1/10) on AO3, based on Famdom/Relationship and Additional Tags. Hopefully output csv with Title, Author, Link and Description on Local Drive.
Used CoLab to run everything, csv file can save locally.
Might face problem when scraping multiple pages(this version, it sometimes break and have errors after 120 pages)
